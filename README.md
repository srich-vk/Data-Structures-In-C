Program that implements the logic for different Data Structures in C language.

**1. Priority Queues :** Similar to queues (ie, *First In First Out* logic), but the elements are always ordered. Usually the largest element is at the top, ie, has the most priority. Useful when you have an array whose elements are being continuosly updated based on their relative magnitude.
